Generate commission free online bookings directly on your WordPress site by integrating the igumbi online booking tool/ IBE.

== Description ==

igumbi is a simple and fast online booking tool/ internet booking engine (IBE) for a hotel, apartment or holiday rental website (also an online hotelsoftware/ PMS and a revenue-/ yield-management system). 

Stripe can be used to charge the guest via creaditcard or other payment methods automatically at the time of booking. 

Used by hotels, bed and breakfasts, apartments, holiday rentals: apartments or holiday houses.

The plugin makes the booking tool (IBE) available to your WordPress site, without the need to manually manage free rooms and prices. You will use the igumbi backend to handle your daily business and reservations, send emails via email-templates like offers and confirmations, create invoices, assign rooms, check in and register your guests, track deposits.

The igumbi booking tool (IBE) gives your site visitors dynamic room/ apartment prices based on revenue management methods, which also implement an upselling strategy. This helps you, as the property owner, to earn more and pay less OTA comissions for your online bookings. To connect to other booking portals/ OTAs, like booking.com, HRS or expedia igumbi can be connected to a channel manager. igumbi sends the prices, rules and availabilities to the channel manager. igumbi fetches the reservations (booked, modified, cancelled) from your connected portals via the channel manager. your daily pricesare sent from igumbi to the channel manager and then to the portals/ OTAs.

The plugin is free to use, but you do [need an account](https://www.igumbi.com/trial?lang=en) with igumbi.com.

= Create your igumbi account =

A 30 day free trial account is available at [igumbi.com/trial](https://www.igumbi.com/trial?lang=en).
Then go the [settings page](https://www.igumbi.net/settings/mine) and get the 7 character hotel code to hook up the online booking tool with the wordpress plugin.

Before you set the booking tool live on your site, ensure that you have entered all reservations into the igumbi backend (at least for the critical dates) so that the correct daily availability can be calculated.

= Display the booking tool where you need it =

With the new plugin architecture, you can now leverage the flexibility of the shortcodes to display the elements of the igumbi booking tool in your pages or on your widgetized areas (sidebar, footer, header).

= Tune the colors of the booking tool by adjusting the CSS =

You can overwrite the CSS generated by the igumbi booking tool to match the look and feel of your sites theme in the igumbi backend or via the WordPress igumbi Settings Page.

Check out the [official site](https://www.igumbi.com/en/wordpress) for details and screenshots.

= Talk to us to get Stripe set up =

There are a few options of how the booking process can be set up with stripe.com to automate invoiceing and payments:
 
With Stripe as a payment provider:

  * Full payment with an invoice issued at the time of booking.d
  * Deposit (percentage of total) and a second payment before arrival - usually used by more expensive rentals like longer stays or villas.
  * Only take the card details for optional charging later.

Witout Stripe:

  * Set up the system so that the guests get an email to pay via banktransfer (deposit or full amount)
  * No payment information requires - higher conversion but risk of late cancellations and noshows.
  
Depending on your desired setup, the email templates that are sent out after booking to the guests need to be customized. We will help you to get this set up properly in a support call.

= Embed the Availability Calendars =

Availability calendars for the next calendar year are generated for each productcategory. Embed the calendars on your sites page describeing the categories. This is especially useful for villas, holiday rentals and apartments.

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin, add it to your blog in the plugin folder and activate it.
* Go to the WordPress settings page (igumbi online bookings) and fill out the details. Get the 'Hotel code' from the [hotel settings page in igumbi](https://www.igumbi.net/settings/mine).
* Add to any page, post, or as a sidebar widget. Integrate with shortcodes [igumbi_dialog] and [igumbi_avform] into your site template. [igumbi_dialog] needs to be placed into your template/page where you want the response of the booking system. You can get all fancy with [igumbi_avform wide=true lang=es] to handle different layouts and languages from within your template.
* Tweak and overwrite the CSS to match the look of your template via the igumbi backend or the custom CSS field in the settings page in the WordPress backend.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this integrate a reservation backend into my WordPress blog? =

No, this plugin will help you place the igumbi online booking tool into your WordPress site. To manage your rates, availability and reservations you will use the igumbi backend.

= Can the plugin handle payments after accepting the reservation? =

Yes it can. If you have a stripe.com account stripe can be set as the payment processor. There are three modes: Charge the whole amount at the time of booking or charge a deposit which can be specified as a percentage of the total amount. You can also just get the card to secure the booking, you can manually charge it later

= How can I style of the booking tool to be in line with my theme? =

You can overwrite the CSS of the booking tool via the igumbi backend (recommended) or via the WordPress settings page (easier for a designer that maintains to WordPress Installation for a property)

= Which languages do you support? =

The online booking tool is available in German, German Du (Duzen), English, Greek, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Japense and Polish.

Bear in Mind that you will need to translate the product names and descriptions and the productcategory descriptions for all the languages you want to support via the igumbi backend [Hotel data > Translations]. If you require other languages, we can integrate them if you are willing to help with the translation: there are around 100 words/phrases in the booking tool. We support UTF-8, so Asian languages should not be a problem.

= The booking tool uses Javascript, what if there are conflicts (typically image gallery)? =

The booking tool uses jQuery but has the "$" function  mapped to the "$igu" function. This is the one we use for the Javascript calls. We have tested extensively with other sites and javascript libraries. However the web is vast: if you do encounter an issue, we are very eager to fix it. Please [let us know it](https://www.igumbi.com/de/kontakt).
